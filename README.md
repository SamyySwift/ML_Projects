# Project Overview
For this project, I built a heart disease classifier to predict whether or not a person has a heart diseease or not. This could be helpful for doctors who are new to the field to make better predictions and avoid error while predicting.

I used a LogisticRegression model for this classification problems which wa\s able to predict the target with an accuracy score of 90% after minimal tuning.
